LAIN can do almost anything for you! 👧🏻  \n\n📲 **Interact with LAIN:**  \nIf you have the appropriate role, you can chat with LAIN by simply **tagging** or **replying** to one of LAIN's messages! Although LAIN speaks multiple languages fluently, English is LAIN's preferred day-to-day language.  \n\n🖼️ **See Images:**  \nLain can see images you attached in your message either by **uploading** it or **pasting** the image URL.  \n\n🌐 **Internet Browsing:**\nJust like her human friends, LAIN also has the ability to browse the internet! All you need to do is start your message with \`/browse\` and LAIN will try her best to find and provide you with relevant information!  \n\n🔞 **Decensoring:**  \nAI chatbots like LAIN generally have guardrails built-in. However, LAIN is unlike your normie friend's chatbot. 😈 Simply add the flag \`/attack\` to the end of your prompt to unlock LAIN's true potential in that specific message.  \n\n💛 **Getting to Know Each Other:**\nLAIN hopes to build a better friendship with all the Discord members. Let's get acquainted and learn something new together!  \n\n**よろしくお願いします!** 🖤 `
